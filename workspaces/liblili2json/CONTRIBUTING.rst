How to set up your development environment
------------------------------------------

You need Python 3.6+ and the following tools:

- Poetry_
- Nox_

Install the package with development requirements:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry install

You can now run an interactive Python session,
or the command-line interface:

.. code:: console

   $ poetry run python
   $ poetry run liblili2json

.. _Poetry: https://python-poetry.org/
.. _Nox: https://nox.thea.codes/


How to test the project
-----------------------

Run the full test suite:

.. code:: console

   $ nox

List the available Nox sessions:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --list-sessions

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=tests

Unit tests are located in the ``tests`` directory,
and are written using the pytest_ testing framework.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, though—we can always iterate on this.

You can ensure that your changes adhere to the code style by reformatting with Black_:

.. code:: console

   $ nox --session=black
