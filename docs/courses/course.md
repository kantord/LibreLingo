# LibreLingo Documentation on Course

A **Course** is the highest element on the course structure. It contains modules, which in turn contains skills. There are usually one course for each language.

To get a better understanding, you can explore the [`courses` directory](https://github.com/LibreLingo/LibreLingo/tree/main/courses) on this repository and read the [course basics](README.md#basics).

## Tree structure

A typical tree structure for a course is like this:

```
courses/spanish-from-english/
├── activities
│   ├── module.yaml
│   └── skills
│       ├── continuous.yaml
│       └── ser_estar.yaml
├── basics
│   ├── module.yaml
│   └── skills
│       ├── animals.yaml
│       ├── clothes.yaml
│       ├── food.yaml
│       ├── nature.yaml
│       ├── plurals.yaml
│       ├── professions.yaml
│       ├── verb_plurals.yaml
│       └── verbs.yaml
├── course.yaml
└── introduction
    ├── module.yaml
    └── skills
        ├── adjectives.yaml
        ├── phrases.yaml
        └── preferences.yaml
```

Here, `activities`, `basics` and `introduction` are [modules](module.md). The `continuous.yaml`, `animals.yaml` etc. are [skills](skill.md). Directly inside the course directory there is also a file called `course.yaml`. This file contains information about the course ([see below](#yaml)).

A course directory name should not have spaces and should be written in `slug-form` in plain English.

## `course.yaml`

A `course.yaml` file for the Spanish course looks like this:

```yaml

#### Automated spell checker

To avoid mistakes, you can enable automatic spell checking in your course. Automatic spell checking won't let you export
a course if it has spelling mistakes. This can prevent incorrect changes from being merged into your course.

The spell checker is implemneted using Hunspell. In order to use it, you need to have Hunspell installed on your
computer.

To install Hunspell, follow the instructions of your operating system. On Ubuntu, you can install Hunspell like so:

```bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y hunspell
```

Don't forget to also install a dictionary for the languages that you use in your course. Here's a list of 
dictionary packages available on Ubuntu: https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/hunspell-dictionary

In order to enable Hunspell in your course, add the following section to your `course.yaml`:

```yaml
Settings:
  Hunspell:
    German: de  # replace with the langauge code for your language
    English: en-US  # replace with the langauge code for your language
```

Keep in mind that you also need to have the `hunspell` Python package installed. To install it, just run:

```bash
pip install hunspell
```
