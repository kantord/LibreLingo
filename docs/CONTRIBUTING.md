# Contributing

This project has 2 main components

-   Frontend, implemented using Svelte and TypeScript
-   A set of Python packages that provide tooling for course creation
-   ~Course editor, implemented using Django~ We don't have a Django based course editor anymore

The site is statically built and hosted on GitHub pages, therefore there's no real "backend" or API.
