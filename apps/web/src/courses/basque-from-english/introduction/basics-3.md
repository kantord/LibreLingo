## The NOR/Absolutive case

*   This lesson continues introducing the main parts of the first case in Basque, the NOR/Absolutive case, which is used with the subject of intransitive verbs (verbs without objects) and the object of transitive verbs(verbs with objects), which will be discussed later.

### Nor Case, Plural Definite

*   Plural definite
    
    *   Ending: -ak
    *   Example: EtxeAK (houses)
    
    
    
*   The plural definite form of Basque nouns is used give Basque nouns the equivalent of an English plural ending (s).
*   Izan sentences use the NOR case, so you would add "-ak" (mutil → mutilak) to plural nouns.
*   Note: If the word ends in an "a" in the Indefinite form, another is not added in the Plural Definite form.
*   Ex: Neska(girl, a girl, the girl): Neskak(girls)

Also, if the indefinite form of the word ends in an "r", for the Plural forms the "r" is normally, but not always, doubled.
+ Ex: Txakur - txakurrak, but paper - paperak (not paperrak).

## Plural Pronouns and IZAN (to be)

### Plural Pronouns

*   Gura (We)
*   Zuek (You(plural))
*   Haiek (They)

## Izan (to be)

### Izan declination

*   The forms of Izan are irregular, and need to be memorized.
    
    *   Gu gara: We are
    *   Zuek zarete: You (plural) are
    *   Haiek dira: They are
    
    
    
*   Izan sentences use the NOR case mentioned above, so you would add "-ak" (mutil → mutilak) for plural definite nouns.
