## Basque Adjectives

While word order in Basque can be very flexible, normally adjectives follow nouns, and for noun phrases(NP), only the last item in a noun phrase has the grammatical suffix added to it. You can think of a noun phrase as a train, with the noun(N) as the engine and the caboose as the grammatical suffix. So it does not matter how many adjectives(A)(freight cars) are added to the train, only the last one is changed. So a sentence can have just a noun (engine) with a grammatical suffix (caboose) or there can be a lot of adjectives (freight cars) in the middle.

#### One noun and grammatical ending. (One locomotive and a caboose)

*   (NP) KotxeA(N) da(V). : It is a car.
*   (NP)KotxeAK(N) dira(V).: They are cars.

#### One noun, one adjective and a grammatical ending.(One locomotive, one freight car and a caboose)

*   (NP) Kotxe(N) gorriA(A) da(V). : It is a red car
*   (NP) Kotxe(N) gorriAK(A) dira(V). : They are red cars.

#### One noun, two adjectives, and a grammatical ending.(One locomotive, two freight cars and acaboose)

*   (NP) Kotxe(N) gorri(A) handiA(A) da(V). : It is a big, red car.
*   (NP) Kotxe(N) gorri(A) handiAK(A) dira(V). : They are big, red cars.

### Complementary Adjectives

When a sentence includes a complementary adjective(CA), (which in English is separated by the verb ‘to be’), both the noun, or last part of a noun phrase of the subject (S) and the complementary adjective (CA) have a grammatical suffix added.
* (NP) Kotxe(N) gorri(A) handiA(A) altuA(CA) da(V). : The big, red car is tall
* (NP) Kotxe(N) gorri(A) handiAK(A) altuAK(CA) dira(V). : The big, red cars are tall.
