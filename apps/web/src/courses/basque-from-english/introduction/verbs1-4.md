## Non-conjugated Intransitive verbs

*   All verbs have non-conjugated form, meaning they do are not conjugated, but are used with a helper verb (Izan or Ukan).
*   Some verbs are also conjugated, change the form with tense and subject, and will be studied later.
*   Intransitive Verbs are verbs that do not take an object, meaning can’t answer “what”) use IZAN as an auxilary verb
*   Ex:You can say “What did he do?, but not “What did he go? So “go” is intransitive and uses IZAN.

### Future

*   future participle stem + Present of “to be” (IZAN)
*   Ni bihar iritsiko naiz
*   I will arrive tomorrow.
*   It can also translated as the modal shall or will (shall we something?)
*   The future participle stem of non-conjugated verbs adds -ko (or -go if the word ends in -n) to the dictionary form.
*   Thus iritsi (to arrive) becomes iritsiko.
