To Be or Not To Be - Egon and the NON(Inessive) Case\n\n## Egon (To Be)\n\n*   Southern Basque (like Spanish) has two different verbs that can be translated as "to be"; Izan and Egon.\n*   Izan, discussed earlier, is used for facts or qualities that are fairly permanent, fixed attributes of something.\n*   For example:\n    \n    *   Mutila naiz. I am a boy.\n    *   Hura handia da. He is big.\n    *   Ni Italiarra naiz. I am Italian.\n    \n    \n    \n*   Egon is used to express temporary states or locations. For example:\n    \n    *   Mutila zikina dago. The boy is dirty.\n    *   Mikel Donostian dago. Mikel is in San Sebastian.\n    *   Euskal herrian dago. He/She is in Basque country.\n    *   Etxean nago. I am at home.\n    \n    \n    \n*   Northern Basque (in France) does not have this distinction, so "to be" is translated as izan in almost all contexts.\n*   In Northern Basque, egon is used to mean "to stay" instead of "to be", so\n*   "Euskal herrian dago" would mean "I am staying in Basque Country" not "I am in Basque Country".\n*   Note that both Egon and Izan are also used to describe feelings. Nekatuta nago. I am tired.(Emotions will be covered later in this course).\n*   When using Egon (or Izan in Northern Basque) to show that a subject is in or at a location you need to use the Inessive case, which answers the question NON - where.\n\n## Inessive(NON) Case\n\n*   The inessive NON case is only used with inanimate objects and is used to show the subject is in, on or upon something/someplace.\n*   In this lesson you will be introduced to the single definite form of the NON - Inessive\n*   The NON - Inessive case is used to show that the subject(s) is in/on/upon the ojbect(s).\n*   Single definite\n    \n    *   Ending: -(E)AN\n    *   Examples: etxeAN (in a house) haranEAN (in a valley)\n    \n    \n    \n*   When adding suffixes, A+E = E, A+A=A, others are added, like exEEtan.\n*   Egon can also be used to mean "There is" or "There are" (Hontza da/dago There is an owl), but normally to emphasis the existence of something, the affirmative particle "ba-" is used with the conjugated verbs and placed before the subject. - Badago hontza.\n*   Note that the ba- particle is not used with negative sentences.\n    \n    *   Txoria dago zuhaitzean. The bird is in the tree.\n    *   Badago txori bat zuhaitzean. There is a bird in the tree.\n    *   Ez dago txori zuhaitzean. There is not a bird in the tree.\n    \n    \n    \n\n### Vocabulary Egon 1\n\n*   Ni nago: I am\n*   Zu zaude: You are\n*   Hura dago: He/she/it is\n*   Gu gaude: We are\n*   Zuek zaudete: You (plural) are\n*   Haiek daude: They are\n*   zuhaitz: tree\n*   non: where\n*   kanpo: outside\n*   barruan: inside\n\n[ Go Back to Home Page!](..)'}}]);
